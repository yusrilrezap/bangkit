                Flexbox provides a more efficient way to layout, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. With properties like <code>display: flex</code>, <code>justify-content</code>, and <code>align-items</code>, you can achieve versatile and responsive designs without the need for complex CSS hacks.
